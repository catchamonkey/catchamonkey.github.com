This is a work in progress, and I have just finished writing the core structure, which offers Pie and Line charting now, and will soon provide stacked etc.  
Rather than repeat myself, you can read more, including usage examples over at the project page [http://chris.sedlmayr.co.uk/phighcharts/](http://chris.sedlmayr.co.uk/phighcharts/ "Project Page on Github")

The code is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/catchamonkey/phighcharts "View the code on Github")
is also installable using [composer/packagist](http://packagist.org/packages/catchamonkey/phighcharts "Install via Composer & Packagist")
and is continuously integrated by [Travis](http://travis-ci.org/#!/catchamonkey/phighcharts "See the unit tests on Travis CI") [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/catchamonkey/phighcharts.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/catchamonkey/phighcharts)

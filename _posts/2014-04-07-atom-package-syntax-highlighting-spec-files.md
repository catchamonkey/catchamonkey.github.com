title: New Atom package for syntax highlighting of .spec files
date: 7th April 2014
excerpt: My first Atom package provides syntax highlighting of .spec files
---

I've just published my first package for Atom, which provides syntax highlighting for RPM .spec files.

You can install it using the built in package manager, just search for Spec, and the package is called "Language Spec".

Or you can use the apm cli

```bash
apm install language-spec
```

### Why Atom?

I'm not going into a big SublimeText2 vs Atom vs X debate here, I'm playing with it, and I like it.  
Trying new things is part of what I like about being a developer, and Atom has some nice features built it.

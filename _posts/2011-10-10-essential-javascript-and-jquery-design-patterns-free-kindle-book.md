For those of you familiar with the book, quite simply here is a Kindle compatible version.  
For those of you unfamiliar, It's an excellent JavaScript and jQuery Design Patterns book written by Addy Osmani and provided for free.  
You can read all about the book over at [addyosmani.com](http://addyosmani.com/blog/essentialjsdesignpatterns/)

I've converted it for Kindle compatibility, and it's provided here as a download (with permission from Addy of course).

<a href="/downloads/Essential JavaScript Design Patterns For Beginners - Addy Osmani.mobi" onClick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','PDF','Download','AddyOsmaniJavaScriptKindleEBook']); _ictt.push(['_customTrigger', 'DOWNLOAD', {'t':'Addy Osmani JavaScript Kindle eBook'}]);" target="_blank">Download Essential JavaScript and jQuery design patterns for Kindle</a>

It's always worth keeping an eye on Addy's site as the book is frequently updated there, also it's usually a good source of information anyway 
and Addy has published some interesting article of late.  
As Addy releases new versions of the book i'll endeavour to keep the kindle version up to date here.
